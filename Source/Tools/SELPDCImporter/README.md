The SEL PDC Configuration Import Tool is used to import the XML configuration for an [SEL 3373](https://selinc.com/products/3373/) or [SEL 3573](https://selinc.com/products/3573/) Station Phasor Data Concentrator directly into a GPA synchrophasor product, e.g., the openPDC, so that the SEL PDC connection and its associated PMU devices are all automatically configured as inputs.
