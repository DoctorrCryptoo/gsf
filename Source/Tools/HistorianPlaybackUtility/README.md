The openHistorian Playback Utility is used to stream and/or export data from a v1.0 openHistorian archive and is included with GPA synchrophasor products, e.g., the openPDC. The tool is used to export selected signals from a given time-range to a CSV file using a custom format and/or stream the data to a socket for replay purposes.
