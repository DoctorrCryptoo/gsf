The Bulk Calculation State Utility is used control the enabled state for dynamic calculations running in a time-series configuration. The tool is automatically included with the GPA openHistorian product and is used to search and filter action-adapter based dynamic calculations so that calculations can be easily started or stopped in bulk based on search criteria.

Dynamic system calculations can now be added in bulk by the openHistorian web-based input device wizard. These calculations can also include calculation outputs that may only be useful during initial device checkout. For large systems this step can create an exponential number of calculations, this tool is used to help manage which calculations should be running.
